        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>I am primarily a syntactician with a keen interest in the phenomena that lie at the interface between syntax and morphology‚Äîareas that have traditionally been treated as separate modules but are increasingly understood as aspects of a unified syntactic system. My research delves into the intricacies of the verbal domain, with a particular focus on deverbal derivations such as nominalizations. In parallel, I examine issues related to clausal complementation, aiming to uncover how these structures interact within the broader architecture of language.

Working with the Bosnian/Croatian/Montenegrin/Serbian linguistic data, I explore a rich tapestry of microvariation. This empirical lens not only allows me to investigate subtle differences within these languages but also to draw broader comparisons across other Slavic languages. Such comparative work has naturally led me to a deep interest in language variation, prompting me to incorporate quantitative, data-driven techniques‚Äîsuch as corpus analysis and controlled experimental tasks‚Äîinto my research toolkit.

While I align with formal linguistics in its effort to bracket the social aspects of language, treating language as a biological phenomenon, I remain deeply fascinated by the interplay between language and society, culture, identity, and politics. Consequently, a significant portion of my research is dedicated to exploring these interactions. By employing experimental methods within the tradition of variationist sociolinguistics, I strive to detect and quantify the social meanings that underpin linguistic variation.</p>
